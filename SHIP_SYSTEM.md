## Strategy Tips

- Fight smaller enemies you can handle
- Use diplomacy when possible for big reputation gains

### Mid Game (Intrepid to Galaxy)
- Balance combat, exploration, and diplomacy
- Take on bigger enemies for larger reputation rewards
- Build alliances with major factions

### Late Game (Sovereign and beyond)
- You'll need 2000+ reputation for elite ships
- At Rank 8+, focus on diplomatic victories (+50 rep each)
- Combat against Battleships/Dreadnoughts gives 30-50 rep

### Optimal Progression Path
1. **Miranda** → Save 800 for Excelsior (Rank 3)
2. **Excelsior** → Save 1500 for Akira or 1600 for Defiant (Rank 4-5)
3. **Defiant/Akira** → Save 2500 for Sovereign (Rank 6)
4. **Sovereign** → Save 4000 for Odyssey (Rank 8)
5. **Odyssey** → Save 6000+ for Ultimate ships (Rank 10-11)

### Specialist Paths

## Reputation Farming Tips

**Best Reputation Per Hour:**
1. **Diplomatic Alliances** - 50 rep each (but requires high relations)

**Fastest Path to Ultimate Ships:**
- Need 10,000 reputation for Enterprise-J
- Also need Rank 11 (Fleet Admiral) = 10,000 experience
- Estimated: 50-80 hours of gameplay
- Focus on high-value diplomatic missions and major combats
